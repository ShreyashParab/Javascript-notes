      type of error:
      1.comppile time: error during compiling the code , eg syntax error  
      2. runtime: error during runtime of code eg. divide by 0 , hard to detect

     why we use error handeling?
     - runtime errors are hard to detect coz they dont throw u direct error hence error handeling is neccesary to deal with errors easily and effectively
     - to handle any error efficiently and effectively
    
     Syntax:-
     try{
        //suspicious code
     }
     catch(error){
        handle the error
     }

     eg:-
     // without try catch
        console.log(1) //1
        console.log(2) //2
        console.log(eval('5 + something')) //err (rest below will not be displayed bcoz of err)
        console.log(3)
        console.log(4)
        console.log(5)
        
    // with try catch(it executes every line of code without ease.)
    console.log(1) //1
    console.log(2) //2
    try{
        console.log(eval('5 + something'))
    }
    catch(error){
        console.log('this was caught by catch block '+ error) //this was...ReferenceError: something is not defined
    }
    console.log(3) // 3
    console.log(4) //4
    

    finally:- it executes statement inside it whether there is error or not.
    finally{
        something...
    }

    throw:- we can manually throw error for particular case and we can create err

    eg:- if we want to create prog for fact of input number for that no. should be 0 or greater than that
    try{
        let input = -8
        if(input < 0)
        throw new Error('only 0 or positive no. are allowed') //throwing user created err 
    }
    catch(error){
        console.log(error) //display above err
    }
        */
