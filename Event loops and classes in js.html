        Event loops:
        - It keeps track of 1. call stack 2. Task queue
        - if call stack is empty , and there is an event waiting to be executed inside the task queue , event loop will pick that and push it inside call stack

        Call Stack:- A call stack keep track of its place in a code that calls multiple function , whenever function call it got pushes in top of call stack and start executing it when execution complete it pop it from call stack and resume where it left , it has LIFO (Last In First Out) (function which will come at last will execute first) 
        
        task will work as first comes first serve , it have to pick any one of micro task and macro task it will pick macro task

        function LevelTwo() {
        console.log("Inside Level Two!")
        }

        function LevelOne() {
        LevelTwo()
        }

        function main() {
        LevelOne()
        }
        main()

        |               |       first it will execute main then main calls level one then level one calls
        | console.log() |       leveltwo which will display console msg, as console comes last it got execute 
        | leveltwo()    |  =>   completely first after that it will get popped
        | levelone()    |
        | main()        |
        -----------------
        
        |               |       after that level two will complete it leftover and get pooped
        |               |
        | leveltwo()    |  => 
        | levelone()    |
        | main()        |
        -----------------
        
        |               |       similarly for levelone as well
        |               | 
        | levelone()    |  =>
        | main()        |
        -----------------

        |               |
        |               |  =>   similarly for main as well 
        | main()        |
        -----------------

        |              |
        |              |   =>   After executing snd popping everything stack will empty means it has nothing to 
        ----------------        to execute
        EMPTY

        Classes in js:- Template or Blueprint for object

        class Student{
            constructor(){

            }
        }
        constructor: Default method in a class which gets invoked during creation of object
        
        eg:-
        class Student{
            constructor(firstName,lastName){
                this.firstName = firstName
                this.lastName = lastName
                console.log(firstName,lastName)
            }
        }

        let shreyash = new Student('shreyash','parab')

        Methods:
        1. Getters: get/receive some information of created objectproperties/methods
        2. Setters: set values for properties/methods of created object
        
        class Student{
            constructor(firstName,lastName){
                this.firstName = firstName
                this.lastName = lastName
            }

            // Getter method
            displayfullName(){
                console.log(this.firstName +' '+ this.lastName)
            }

            // Getter method
            displayInfo(){
                console.log(JSON.stringify(this))
            }

            // Setter method
            setBatch(batchNo){
                this.batch = batchNo
            }
        }

        let shreyash = new Student('shreyash','parab')
        shreyash.setBatch(10)
        shreyash.displayInfo()
